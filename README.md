# Real_state
Real State housing Pricing prediction by the help of 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes

The Housing Prices data seemed interesting to me because of the large number of features, so in this work I focused on data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection  Then i tested feature sets on several models.
